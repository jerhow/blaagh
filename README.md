# Blaagh

So I'm learning Clojure, and I'd like to get more practical with it,
so a web app seems like a good way to build something interesting.

This repo is me building a personal website AKA a blog AKA a blaagh with Clojure, 
Leiningen, Ring, Compojure, the HTTP Kit server, and some other libraries 
that I'll identify as I progress.

## Usage

Well, currently it'll run with this:

$ lein run -m blaagh.core

...that's about all I can tell you right now. I'm happy it's working at all, 
and I'm having a great time getting off the ground with Clojure.
